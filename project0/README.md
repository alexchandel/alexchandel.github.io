# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I did a lighter take for this project. It's based on Dwight K. Schrute.  It has 4 pages:

* [index.html](./index.html) has a Navbar (with an unordered list),
a Jumbotron, and an image.  It also has a Button group, Buttons, and a grid.

* [bears.html](./bears.html) has a Media object (as do beets.html & bsg.html), a table, a Carousel.

* [beets.html](./beets.html) has an image.

* [bsg.html](./bsg.html) has an ordered list.

The [style.css](./style.css) stylesheet has tag selectors, .class selectors,
\#id selectors, descendent selectors, a child selector, a pseudoclass selector,
a pseudoelementselector.  It modifies 10 properties, and changes the
Bootstrap grid's flex-direction for small screens.
It's compiled from [style.scss](./style.css), which stores the accent color in
a variable for multiple properties, uses inheritance to apply hover properties
to multiple selectors, and using nesting to target multiple descendents.
